# R code

This directory contains the code used to produce the plots in the paper as well as diagnostic plots for tests and the experiments in the paper.

To reproduce the plots in the paper, place the results from all runs in the folder `results/` and execute the corresponding `R`-file in the folder `r/paper`. The plot will be saved as a `pdf`-file in the folder `results/`. The tables are presented directly in the console window.
